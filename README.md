# SlapjackSimulator
Slapjack is a card game that I often play with my friends during lunch. Since there is a lot of randomness involved in the game, I wondered how much players' slapping skill actually affected the outcome of the game. That's why I created a program to simulate slapjack games given the respective "slapping skills" of various players.
Note: slapjack, also called "Egyptian Ratscare" and many other names. The main goal is to obtain all the cards, but there are also hundreds of rule variations. The one used in this program is as follows:
- You can slap on two of the same card or a sandwich (card A, card B, card A consecutively).
- Face cards give the next player different amounts of chances to place another face card (J = 1, Q = 2, K = 3, A = 4 chances).
- If the player fails to play a face card, the original face card placer takes the entire pile.
- Anyone who validly slaps takes the whole pile.
